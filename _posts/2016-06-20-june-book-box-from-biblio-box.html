<div><div>I had never been a part of any book box earlier. This was the first time I subscribed for one. And it did not disappoint me at all! Here are the things I received in the box.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BRxhA8ce9QQ/V2bP3aHa1PI/AAAAAAAADss/RAvtSnKw754nWpHanv3uzICGlJDxfHqnACLcB/s1600/2016-06-12-PHOTO-00001061.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="482" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BRxhA8ce9QQ/V2bP3aHa1PI/AAAAAAAADss/RAvtSnKw754nWpHanv3uzICGlJDxfHqnACLcB/s640/2016-06-12-PHOTO-00001061.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div>&nbsp; <br /><div>A Hardback copy of 'In other words' by the amazing Jhumpa Lahiri. I had read some passages by the author but never a book. This is going to be my first book. Can't wait to read this! </div><div>A hardback copy of 'Ghachar Ghochar '. This is a bestselling book by Vivek Shanbhag. I have already started reading the book. Such beautiful writing. It has got a certain vernacular whiff. Let me tell you more once I finish this. 😊 </div><div>A coffee mug which says 'books be BAE'. We can't get enough of bookish mugs, can we? This one is a beautiful white one with black writing and little hearts! Good one to start my collection with!💕💕 </div><div>Two book marks by the amazing doodler friend. I plan to Color these with pop colors! Such joy!</div><div>A card with some amazing colorful graphics by 'the biblio box'. It's also designed keeping in mind the theme 'India'. It goes directly on my tac board.😊 </div><div>A peacock feather! Yes a beautiful long peacock feature to go with the theme! I use it as a book mark. It's gorgeous! ❤️❤️ </div><div>And finally a note from TBB. It says 'We hope you enjoy your biblio box! Team TBB.' </div><div>Well, thank you TBB! I absolutely love the box!</div><div>Don't forget to check out July box. It revolves around the theme 'magical realism'. </div></div></div>
